# Session Log

## Session 1 — 2026-02-19
- What was done: Project folder created. Assets collected (photos, logos, screenshots, slides, affordability data xlsx). CLAUDE.md, plan.md, log.md created.
- Decisions made: Single-page HTML, inline CSS/JS, vanilla JS only, GitHub Pages deployment. Repo name: dga-affordability-gap.
- Next session should: Start Phase 1 — extract colors from homium screenshots, convert xlsx to JS data object, review gamma template for content, then begin building index.html.
